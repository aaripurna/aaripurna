- 👋 Hi, I am Nawa (Aripurna) You can find me on most social media as @aaripurna
- 👀 I am interested in many things including STEM (Most of them), Art, Foods, and Cultures.
     When it comes to art I am interested in sketching, drawing, painting, singing, and dancing (💃) Because, why not?
     note: Just because I am interested does not mean I am good at it 👀.
